# K8s Architecture


## Worker Nodes
3 processes run on each node
- Container runtime (Docker)
- Kubelet
    - Interface with container runtime and node
    - Starts the pod, assign resources
- Kube Proxy
    - Keep traffic local within pod when possible

## Master Nodes
- Handle lifecycle
- API server
    - Cluster gateway
    - Authentication/Authorization
- Scheduler
    - Decides to start pod on a specific node
    - Forwards to Kubelet
- Controller Manager
    - Detect when pods die
    - Reschedule dead pods with Scheduler
- EtcD
    - Key value store of Cluster State
    - Cluster brain
    - App Data is NOT stored




## Minimal Configuration
- 2 Master Nodes (Low Resources)
- 3 Worker Nodes (High Resources)
