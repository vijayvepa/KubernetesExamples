# Kubernetes Components

## Processing

- Container
-Pod 
	- Smallest Unit of K8s
	- Layer over top of container
	- One container per pod
- Node
	- Server
	- Collection of Pods 
	- Each Pod gets its own IP Address

## Routing

- Service
	- Permanent IP address attached to Pod
	- Even if Pod dies, Service will keep IP address
- External Service - accessible from outside
- Internal Service - accessible from inside
	- Load balancer for replication

- Ingress
	- Readable URLs
	- HTTPS

## Configuration

- ConfigMap
	- URLs of DB or other services
	- Pod gets data that config map contains
	- DB_URL=mongodb
	  - Donâ€™t put credentials

- Secret
	- Credentials, stored in base64 encoded

## Storage
- Volumes
	- Attach a physical storage to pod
	- Local or remote (outside of k8s cluster)

- Replication
- Deployments
	- Blueprint
	- Deployments
	- Service handles load balancer
	- DB cannot be replicated

- StatefulSet
	- DB Replicas
	- Tedious
	- DBs hosted outside of K8s cluster
